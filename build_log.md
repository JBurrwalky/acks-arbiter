# ACKS Arbiter — Build Log

This file is the project's cross-session memory. Claude Code reads it at the start of every session and appends an entry at the end. **Never delete old entries.**

## Session 2026-03-25 — Project Initialization

**Task:** Set up project directory structure and build agent configuration.
**Completed:**
- Created CLAUDE.md with full build agent instructions.
- Created build_log.md (this file).
- Project files are currently flat in root. First Claude Code task is to reorganize into `rules/`, `generation/`, `docs/` structure.
**Decisions made:**
- Build agent is Claude Code only (no OpenClaw, no Ollama). Rationale: simpler toolchain, better code quality, lower cost, purpose-built for coding tasks.
- Default model: Sonnet 4.6 for implementation, Opus 4.6 for planning/review.
- Cross-session memory via this build_log.md file rather than a persistent agent daemon.
- Design brief v11 replaces all prior versions. The old rule atom JSON system is fully abandoned; XML rule summaries and GDDs are the authoritative build sources.
**Next session should:**
1. Reorganize files into directory structure (first task in CLAUDE.md).
2. Create the document map (`docs/document_map.md`) — index all XML and GDD files.
3. Create the rule system map (`docs/rule_system_map.md`) — system dependencies and cross-references.
